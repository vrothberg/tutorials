To start the demo, go to the root of the git repository and execute the following command:

`$ sh ./summit_2025/getting_started/demo.sh`

The demo will push an image to a registry.  Use the `IMAGE` environment variable to point to a registry you have access to (e.g., `$ IMAGE=quay.io/myuser/image:demo sh ./...`).
